This is the code repository for [Modern App Development with C# 8 and .NET Core 3.0 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/programming/modern-app-development-with-c-8-and-net-core-3-0-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
C# is rapidly approaching the third decade of its newest features. It helps in preventing the null reference exceptions that have riddled object-oriented programming. C# and .NET Core combined give developers a new sense of robustness, flexibility, and efficiency to build amazing applications inside and outside the MS ecosystem. There are several improvements and additions to the language and framework in this upcoming release.

After quickly taking you through C# 8 and how .NET Core 3.0 works, you'll explore topics such as packaging and deploying your own libraries, working with Visual Studio and other relevant tools, and using common libraries to work with collections, performance, databases, and encryption. 

The course practically demonstrates the major types of applications that you can build and deploy cross-device and cross-platform—web, mobile, and desktop alike.
